# TAILOREDhair
### Concept by: Foryst Jankela

  | A social media platform markup for hair stylists and colorists |
        | Inspired by Tailored Salon in San Francisco, CA |

## Deployment
  Deployed on Heroku @ https://hair-looks.herokuapp.com/

### Built With
  | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | jQuery | Express | MongoDB |

### Approach
  In creating this full-stack app, I utilized Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS to adhere to the MVC file structure using all 7 restful routes and CRUD. For this social media app, I needed 2 models - one for photos and one for users. I implemented a one to many relationship between the two. In the future, I will go forward with adding a third model - comments - as well. I have a love for styling, so I made sure to craft my CSS to a professional stand-point.

### Technical Difficulties
  * Adding a photo to only the user's account that is signed in. I had difficulty with the photos posting to each user's account, thus trippling on the feed page.
  * Creating an all user's page. I have a page where each user is printed on the screen, however I was not able to make them link to anyone other than the currently signed in user.

### What I hope to add
  * A page to display all users
  * Commenting on photos from users
  * Randomly generated photos to appear on the home page spotlight area
    instead of the most recent.

### Credits
  All photos, and title of markup are shared with &hearts; by Tailored Salon in San Francisco, CA
